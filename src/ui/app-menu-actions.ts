 * The app-drawn menu's items that never had a native id to send.

 * Paste, Select All, Toggle Full Screen) - muda generates their ids and
 * offers no way to fire one from outside a click, so `trigger_menu_item`
 * cannot reach them. Every one of them is already implemented on this side
 * anyway: the editing five are what the right-click menu runs (see
 * editor/useEditorClipboard.ts and the EDIT_ACTION_EVENT listener in
 * MilkdownEditor.tsx), and fullscreen is a window API call.
