/**
 * Listen to a Tauri event addressed to THIS window only.
 *
 * Use this, never the bare `listen()` from @tauri-apps/api/event: that one
 * registers with target `{ kind: "Any" }`, and an Any-target listener is a
 * deliberate catch-all on the Rust side - it receives every emit app-wide,
 * INCLUDING ones a `emit_to(EventTarget::webview_window(label), ...)` meant
 * for one specific window (tauri's event/listener.rs: `match_any_or_filter`
 * short-circuits to true before the target filter ever runs). With two
 * windows open, every window-scoped event therefore fired in all of them -
 * a file opened in tab mode landed in each window, a menu command ran once
 * per window, a dragged tab was received by windows it was never dropped on.
 *
 * Passing a label narrows the listener to `AnyLabel`, which matches the
 * Window/Webview/WebviewWindow forms of that same label (so it still catches
 * `emit_to` from Rust and `emitTo` from another window's JS) and nothing
 * addressed elsewhere. Every event in this app is window-addressed - Rust
 * only ever calls `emit_to`, never the broadcasting `emit` - so there is
 * nothing left that legitimately wants the catch-all.

 * otherwise costs a `void sub.then((f) => f())` line in a hand-written
 * cleanup - fifteen of them in useMenuBridge alone. Worth collapsing because
 * the failure mode is silent: miss a line and that listener outlives the
