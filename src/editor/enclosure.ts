/**
 * Shared model for every delimiter-enclosed syntax construct - bold/italic/
 * strikethrough/highlight (md_span), inline code (md_code_span), and math
 * (math_inline/math_block). All of them are real ProseMirror nodes whose
 * content is real, always-editable text; the wrapping markdown delimiters
 * ("**", "~~", "==", "`", "$", "$$") are NOT characters in the document -
 * they're derived from the node type/attrs and synthesized as non-editable
 * widget decorations. This module is the single owner of how the cursor and
 * editing keys interact with that synthesized syntax.
 *
 * The cursor has three phases relative to an enclosure, and Left/Right move
 * exactly one phase per press, so the delimiter behaves like a single
 * editable pseudo-character even though it occupies no document position:
 *
 *   away:      ... text | *hello*        delimiters hidden (or, for math,
 *                                        the KaTeX render shown instead)
 *   adjacent:  ... text |*hello*         cursor at the node's outer boundary;
 *              ... text *hello*|         delimiters revealed, cursor visually
 *                                        outside them
 *   inside:    ... text *|hello*         cursor within the content; normal
 *                                        text editing applies
 *
 * Editing the delimiters themselves maps onto this model as deletion and
 * re-creation rather than character mutation:
 *
 *   - Backspace in the "adjacent after" position deletes the CLOSING
 *     delimiter: the node unwraps into literal text that still carries its
 *     opening delimiter ("*hello*" -> "*hello"), exactly like erasing the
 *     last character of hand-typed markdown.
 *   - Backspace at the very start of the content deletes the OPENING
 *     delimiter ("*|hello*" -> "|hello*"); Delete (forward) mirrors both.
 *   - Typing the delimiter character again re-forms the node from that
 *     literal text (see findRunOpen below + the autopair plugins), so a
 *     deleted delimiter is always recoverable by just retyping it.
 *   - Backspace/Delete on an EMPTY shell removes the whole pair at once,
 *     like erasing an auto-closed bracket.
 *
 * Why every boundary crossing is intercepted in handleKeyDown instead of
 * left to the browser: the synthesized delimiters aren't real text, so
 * native caret movement either stalls against them or - in WKWebView, the
 * Tauri webview - gets silently normalized to the wrong side of the node
 * element. The same normalization also mis-attributes text typed at a
 * boundary to the node's content; redirectMisattributedInput below is the
 * counterpart guard for that, called by the autopair plugins.
 *
 * Division of labor across the feature's files:
 *   - *-schema.ts:          node shape, markdown parse/serialize
 *   - *-autopair-plugin.ts: what typing a delimiter character does (open /
 *     upgrade / close / convert literal text), via the helpers exported here
 *   - enclosure.ts:         cursor phases, delimiter reveal, delimiter
 *     deletion - everything selection- and key-driven, uniformly
 *   - math-preview-plugin.ts: math-only extras (KaTeX render while away,
 *     floating live preview while inside)
