/**
 * The protocol between an editor window and its detached chat window.
 *
 * The split is deliberate and one-directional in authority: the EDITOR
 * remains the sole owner of the document and of pending edits. A detached
 * chat window renders a conversation and asks for things; it never writes to
 * a document, never resolves an anchor, and holds no preview state of its
 * own. That keeps the "one place edits are applied" property the embedded
 * panel already has (see usePendingEdits) instead of growing a second
 * implementation that could drift.
 *
 * The chat window is also the CROSS-FILE surface (the in-document Quick Ask
 * bar is the per-file one), so which editor it is talking to is not fixed
 * for its lifetime. It re-addresses itself on every context push: whichever
 * editor last sent one is the editor its proposals and accept/reject calls
 * go back to. That is why `ChatContext` carries `editorLabel` - one
 * mechanism keeps "which document is on screen" and "where do replies go" in
 * lockstep, rather than two that can disagree.
 *
 * Transport is Tauri's window-targeted events (`emitTo`), so no Rust relay is
 * involved - the backend only creates the window, decides how many may exist
 * (commands/chat_window.rs), and hands over the initial state.
