 * The editor's state right now, as the detached chat window needs it.

 * This is what makes the detached window the CROSS-FILE surface: it holds no
 * snapshot of its own, so whatever the active editor reports here is the
 * document it is about, the selection its chip shows, and the file its edits
 * land in. Contrast the in-document Quick Ask bar, which deliberately keeps
 * the snapshot taken when it opened (useInlineChat) - an inline command bar
 * that re-targeted itself mid-conversation would be unpredictable, while a
 * window the user keeps open beside their work is expected to follow along.
 *
 * Reading the whole document is not free (every top-level block is
 * re-serialized to markdown), which is why callers push this on selection,
 * tab and file changes - discrete user actions - and on demand before a
 * send, never on every keystroke.
