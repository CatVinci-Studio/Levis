/**
 * Finds `needle`'s single occurrence within the RENDERED PLAIN TEXT of a
 * document range, returning its real ProseMirror position range - or null
 * when absent or ambiguous (more than one occurrence).
 *
 * This is the escape hatch from doc-markdown.ts's "a markdown offset inside
 * a block has no ProseMirror position" constraint: that constraint is about
 * MARKDOWN-SOURCE offsets, which don't map to positions because markdown
 * syntax density varies (a bold span is 4 extra characters in source but 0
 * in rendered text). Plain-text offsets have no such ambiguity - walking a
 * doc's actual text nodes to convert a plain-text offset back into a
 * position is a direct, unambiguous operation, the same one `doc.textBetween`
 * already does in the forward direction.
 *
 * SINGLE BLOCK ONLY: the position walk sums text-node lengths without
 * accounting for the block-separator characters `textBetween`'s search text
 * inserts between sibling block nodes, so a [from, to) spanning more than
 * one top-level block would search correctly but map positions wrong past
 * the first separator it crosses. Callers must confirm the range is within
 * one block first (usePendingEdits.ts does, via the serialized block list
 * it already has); this function does not check.
