# Authoring a Levis theme

## The two things called "theme"

They are different mechanisms and the distinction decides everything else.

**Built-in content themes** (`src/editor/content-themes.css`) set CSS custom
properties and nothing else. They reskin the **writing area only** - never the
app chrome. Shipping one means editing three files (see _Adding a built-in
theme_).

**Imported themes** are arbitrary Typora-compatible CSS files a user picks in
Settings. They are read, inlined, and injected into a `<style>` tag at
runtime. They can style anything, and they are a user's file - not part of the
repo.

## Appearance and theme are orthogonal

Two independent settings compose into what the user sees:

| Setting   | Values                                                                 | Attribute on `<html>`                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `themeId` | `default`, `paper`, `slate`, `forest`, `parchment`, or a user theme id | `data-content-theme` (absent for `default`) |
| `theme`   | `system`, `light`, `dark`                                              | `data-theme` (**absent** for `system`)      |

There is no such thing as "a dark theme". Every theme must define both forms,
because the user can pick any combination. `system` deliberately removes
`data-theme` so the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` rules answer - which
is how the app follows an OS switch live, with no JS listener.

**Every content theme is therefore three blocks, in this order:**

```css
[data-content-theme="x"] {
  /* the light form, plus anything shared between both (fonts) */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root:not([data-theme="light"])[data-content-theme="x"] {
    /* dark, for "follow system" */
  }
}

:root[data-theme="dark"][data-content-theme="x"] {
  /* dark, pinned - identical to the block above */
}
```

The two dark blocks are identical by construction. The base block is
unconditional, so the dark ones restate only what actually **changes**
(colours) and inherit the rest.

A theme with a single design still needs all three blocks - give the dark ones
the same values as the base. Otherwise switching appearance half-applies it:
dark chrome around light content.

## What a theme can define

### Content variables — what content themes set

Everything here is scoped to the writing area.

| Variable                | Controls                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--editor-bg`           | Editor background. Falls back to `--bg`, so `default` leaves it unset.                                                                  |
| `--editor-text`         | Body text.                                                                                                                              |
| `--editor-muted`        | Secondary text: placeholders, counts, tool lines, most icons. The single most-used variable - it carries the app's whole "quiet" layer. |
| `--editor-accent`       | Links, the caret, focus rings, active states, accepted-edit highlights. The most visible colour in the app.                             |
| `--editor-border`       | Hairlines, table rules, input outlines.                                                                                                 |
| `--editor-code-bg`      | Inline code and code-block background.                                                                                                  |
| `--editor-quote-border` | The blockquote's leading rule.                                                                                                          |
| `--editor-highlight-bg` | `==marked==` text and find-match highlights. Defined in `App.css`; built-in content themes leave it alone.                              |
| `--editor-font`         | Content font stack. Only read once, as `var(--editor-font, var(--font-sans))`. Include CJK families - see _Gotchas_.                    |
| `--editor-list-gap`     | Vertical gap between list rows: the margin on an item's paragraph and on nested lists. Falls back to `0.4em` (tighter than prose).      |

### Chrome variables — NOT for content themes

`--bg`, `--sidebar-bg`, `--sidebar-text`, `--sidebar-hover`,
`--sidebar-active`, `--sidebar-active-text`, `--border-color`, `--danger`,
`--font-sans`. These are the window frame. `content-themes.css` deliberately
never touches them: picking a theme reskins the writing area, not the whole
app. Only `App.css` sets these, in its `:root` / dark pair.

### Two more families, in `milkdown-theme.css`

`--token-string`, `--token-number`, `--token-keyword`, `--token-function`,
`--token-tag` — code-block syntax highlighting.

`--md-alert-note`, `--md-alert-tip`, `--md-alert-important`,
`--md-alert-warning`, `--md-alert-caution`, `--md-alert-accent` — GitHub-style
alert blocks.

Both follow the same three-block light/dark structure. Built-in content themes
do not override them; a theme that wants its own syntax palette can.

## Adding a built-in theme

Three files, all required - miss one and the theme is invisible or crashes the
picker.

1. **`src/editor/content-themes.css`** - the three blocks above.
2. **`src/settings/SettingsContext.tsx`** - add the id to
   `BuiltinContentThemeId` and an entry to `BUILTIN_CONTENT_THEMES`
   (`{ id, name, nameKey }`).
3. **`src/i18n/strings.ts`** - add the `nameKey` string to **all three**
   language blocks (en, zh, ja). `nameKey` is typed `StringKey`, so a missing
   one is a type error rather than a runtime surprise.

Then check every combination: the new theme in light, in dark, and under
"follow system" with the OS flipped both ways.

## Imported (Typora) themes

Users pick a `.css` file in Settings > Theme. `src/utils/theme-import.ts`
makes it self-contained before storing it:

- `@import` of a local file is **recursively inlined** (with a circular-import
  guard). Remote `@import`s are left as-is.
- Local `url(...)` assets - fonts, images - are **base64-inlined** as data
  URIs. Recognised extensions: woff2, woff, ttf, otf, png, jpg/jpeg, gif, svg,
  webp. A missing asset leaves the original reference rather than failing the
  import.
- Remote and `data:` URLs pass through untouched.

This is necessary because the CSS ends up in a runtime `<style>` tag with no
base URL, so nothing relative would resolve.

**Selectors that work.** The editor's ProseMirror root carries `id="write"`
specifically so community Typora themes apply without rewriting. Content also
sits under `.milkdown`. Target `#write` for Typora compatibility.

**Imports are single-file**: `hasDark` is `false` for anything imported through
the UI, so the same stylesheet is used in both appearances - which is the right
behaviour for a one-design theme (see the rule above). The data model supports
a dark variant - `themes.saveThemeCss(id, "dark", css)` in `src/ipc.ts` - for
themes that ship one; the import UI only ever writes `"light"`.

## Gotchas

**Don't add a variable nothing defines.** Several `var(--x, fallback)` hooks
exist that no stylesheet ever sets, so only the fallback is ever used - they
look like theming points but aren't. Before introducing one, check it is
actually defined somewhere:

```
rg -o -- '--[a-z-]+\s*:' src --type css | sort -u    # defined
rg -o -- 'var\(--[a-z-]+' src --type css | sort -u   # used
```

**CJK fonts need naming explicitly.** `--editor-font` stacks must list CJK
families (`"Songti SC"`, `"Noto Serif CJK SC"`, ...) - a Latin-only stack
silently falls back to a system default for Chinese and Japanese text.

**Don't set `font-synthesis: none`.** `App.css` sets `font-synthesis: style`
on purpose: PingFang and Noto CJK ship no italic face, so without synthesis
`*emphasis*` on Chinese/Japanese renders upright. An imported theme that
turns synthesis off loses CJK italics entirely.

**`--editor-bg` is unset by default.** Consumers read
`var(--editor-bg, var(--bg))`. If a theme sets it, make sure the dark form
sets it too, or dark mode will show a light editor on dark chrome.

**Contrast both ways.** A colour tuned against a light background usually
fails against the dark one. The dark blocks are separate values, not a
filter - check them.

## Verify

```
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
npx eslint src --max-warnings=0
npx vitest run
```

CSS itself is unchecked by any of these, so the theme has to be looked at:
run the app, then walk Settings > Theme through the new theme in light, dark,
and follow-system.
